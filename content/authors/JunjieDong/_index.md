Dong Junjie's research focuses on acoustic micro-nano robot system design and intelligent control, covering ultrasound control technology, robot fault tolerance and robust control algorithms and biomedical applications. He is committed to optimizing the penetration and focusing performance of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) through acoustic metamaterials, combining simulation modeling with experimental verification, and promoting its application in the fields of neural control and non-invasive treatment.
