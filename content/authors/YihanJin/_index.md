My work advances medical ultrasound technologies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. I develop robotic platforms to enhance ultrasound imaging, addressing challenges in complex anatomies like intercostal scanning. Concurrently, I investigate ultrasound neuromodulation mechanisms, focusing on transcranial stimulation for non-invasive neurological therapies.

Recently, I engineered a Portable Low-Intensity Therapeutic Ultrasound System (LITUS) integrating metalens technology for precision beam focusing. I am currently characterizing this system and exploring its diverse therapeutic applications, with emphasis on targeted neuromodulation scenarios.
