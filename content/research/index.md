        ### Ionic hydrogel for thermal energy harvesting
        We uncovered a novel n-type thermogalvanic redox couple of Cu2+/+ staby Cl-, exhibiting exceptional performance in output power and thermopower compared with reported n-type i-TE systems.

        <p align="center">
          <img src='researchpic/Slide13.PNG' width=80%/>
        </p>

        Then we reported a novel competitive-coupling mechanism driven by speciation in binary n-type PVA-CuCl2 gels. This mechanism leads to an enhanced thermogalvanic effect with increasing CuCl2 concentrations while suppressing the thermodiffusion. 

        Our experimental characterization, combining SHINERS with surface analytical XPS characterization, is readily adaptable to other redox reaction-active hydrogels or soft-material systems, enabling precise mapping of both coordination and electronic states under operando conditions. 

        <p align="center">
          <img src='researchpic/Slide14.PNG' width=80%/>
        </p>

        This competition driven by speciation explains the non-monotonic trend in thermopower, showing a maximum value of -30.6 mV K-1 at x = 0.1 M. Our findings demonstrate a novel competitive-coupling i-TE mechanism guided by coordination chemistry, offering a universal design principle for high-performance thermal-to-energy conversion systems.

        ### Hydrogel sweat sensor for noninvasive diagnosis
        <p align="center">
          <img src='researchpic/Slide15.PNG' width=80%/>
        </p>

        Thermal hydrogels surpass UV-polymerized in uniformity yet struggle with rough surfaces. Our optimized method yields smooth, optically clear high-n films via simple, equipment-free synthesis.

        1.  Hydrogel patch enables sweat uptake with sensitive biomarker recognition.
        2.  Excellent imaging optical clarity.
        3.  NN achieves near-perfect accuracy (>99.9%) in biomarker concentration detection.

        ### Achievement of High-order Mode in ultrasound-responsive hydrogel
        Ultrasound-responsive hydrogels have recently garnered widespread application in the biomedical field due to their superior biocompatibility and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the development of implantable and wearable advanced devices.

        <p align="center">
          <img src='researchpic/Slide16.PNG' width=80%/>
        </p>

        In this study, we achieved higher-order scattering modes in hydrogels by incorporating gaseous materials, demonstrating superior performance in biomedical ultrasound modulation with retrieved Q-factors. Elevated Q-values enhance device sensitivity and resolution, enabling more precise medical ultrasound applications.
