Dr. Sichao Qu (屈思超) focused on the research of wave-absorbing metamaterials with electromagnetic waves, underwater and airborne sound. He focused on identifying structure-response relation and underlying physical constraints. In particular, he is fascinated by the topics with following features:
1. Renewing physical understanding; 
2. Advancing analytical/numerical methods; 
3. Holding strong application potential.
