Dr. Erqian Dong is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Hong Kong. His research interests focus on acoustic metamaterials, dolphin-inspired acoustics, and medical ultrasound imaging. Dr. Dong graduated from Xiamen University in China with a degree in physical oceanogrpahy. He has also concentrated on acoustic theory, developing high-performance underwater acoustic metamaterials to enable applications such as acoustic detection, acoustic cloaking, and beamforming, aimed at enhancing capabilities in autonomous underwater vehicle, marine fishery resource assessment and pipeline inspection.

In the future, his research activities will expand into applications of medical and underwater metamaterial design, with a focus on addressing challenges in broadband hardware transmission for ultrafast ultrasound imaging systems and integrating artificial intelligence technologies. He is also exploring the use of micro-/nano-materials in ultrasound imaging and robotic ultrasound applications. His research and developed devices could be extended to areas such as dolphin-inspired scientific fish finders, portable ultrasound devices, and point-of-care ultrasound in the future.
