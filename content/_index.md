      title: Lab of Scalable and Sustainable Photonic Manufacturing
      subtitle: "Professor Nicholas Fang's Research Group"
      text: |
        Professor Fang is trained as an applied physicist and educator with focus on optical and acoustic materials. Built upon our unique and world-leading expertise in advanced wave functional materials, Professor Fang's new research team of sustainable nanophotonics at HKU will launch the following research efforts:
        1. Can photonic manufacturing boost the sustainability and efficiency of catalytic conversion?
        2. Can photonic manufacturing enhance the sustainability of networked devices and systems integrated with traditional fibers, yarns, and textiles?
        3. Can 3D organ-on-chip tissue models by photonic manufacturing fully recapitulate the patient-specific evolution of age-related diseases?

        Specialties: photonics, nanofabrication, advanced imaging technology
        
        We invite you to take a look at the publications to get a better idea of our previous research. Feel free to get in touch with Professor Fang to say hi or for more information.
